# ResponsivenessPortfolioRepo
This was a bit challenging, and I could do better with some more time. I attempted to link in a contact-page, but it doesn't work properly. I don't understand the finer points of php.
I'm also not sure yet how to more properly format my about me page with a little more structure. Again, with some more time, I'm certain I could pull this off. 
Obviously some guidance and review would serve me very well. But I did the best I could with what I understand. Bootstrap and applying it will take me some more practice.
